## Git Commit Guidelines

Read this article how to write meaningful commit messages:
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

With the expectations listed below, we follow the rules contained in
[AngularJS's Git Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines):

 -  **Type**: Must be one of the following
     -  **feat**: A new definition, exercise, workshop or material
     -  **fix**: A bug fix
     -  **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
     -  **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
     -  **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

## Working on branches
-  Always work on your separate feature branch. 
-  The name of the branch should contain the title of the feature, your name can be also included but that's optional. 
-  Your name only as a branch name is invalid.

## Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your changes consider the following guidelines:
 -  We use Pull Requests for reviewing definitions and materials
 -  The pull request must be reviewed by an other mentor
     -  The review should include completing (or reviewing if already completed) the solutions for the exercises in the [solutions repository](https://github.com/green-fox-academy/solutions)
 -  Delete your branches after the pull request is merged
